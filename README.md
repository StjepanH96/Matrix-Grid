#  Matrix-grid

Go to the root of the project and start the app with npm start. Also, use npm test to run tests with Jest functionalities.

I used @testing-library/react for testing and added some assertions for state management.

The app is written in JavaScript XML (JSX) with TypeScript. :)

Enjoy!
